            <h2>Likely outcomes</h2>
            Democrats are only favored to flip a few seats. In fact, the most
            likely outcome is a gain or loss of just a couple seats. But the 
            Democrats are competitive in many more districts than the GOP, and 
            they have much more room to grow, since the GOP holds more seats 
            than at any time since the 1920s.  This gives them many more 
            opportunities for upsets, and increases their overall chances of 
            retaking control of the House.

            <h2>Races where &hellip;</h2>
            Democrats have many more safe seats than
            Republicans&mdash;districts where there&rsquo;s virtually no chance 
            that the other party will win.  This is partly the result of
            gerrymandering, and partly a consequence of Democrats&rsquo; natural
            tendency to cluster together in cities. Notice that there are very
            few seats that are expected to flip to the Democrats. But since the
            GOP has many more seats in which they are vulnerable, the Democrats
            are still expected to pick up quite a few seats.

            <h2>Model</h2>
            <p>
            Our goal is to estimate the difference in vote share for the
            Democratic and Republican candidates in each of the four hundred
            thirty five congressional races. We cannot observe this directly;
            we must infer it from a combination of structural factors such as
            economic conditions and incumbency, and polling data, usually from
            a "generic congressional ballot."
            </p>

            <h3>Poll Aggregation</h3>
            <p>
            We first look backwards, aggregating generic congressional ballot
            polls.

            For each poll $i$:
            <ul>
                <li>The sample size is denoted $N_i$.</li>
                <li>The week in which the poll was conducted is denoted $w_i$.</li>
                <li>The month in which the poll was conducted is denoted $m_i$.</li>
                <li>The polling firm conducting the poll is denoted $p_i$.</li>
            </ul>

            A generic congressional ballot poll measures the number of
            respondents who say they would vote for each party&rsqo;s House
            candidate. The number of respondents choosing the Democrat is
            $N_i^D$, which is drawn from a Binomial distribution, $$ N_i^D \sim
            \mathrm{Binomial}(N_i, \pi_i) $$ where $\pi_i$ is the level of
            support for the Democrats in this poll.  Why not use $\mu$?
            Pollsters sample differently and have different methodologies, and
            so the margin of support they measure is different from the true
            margin.

            Various factors contribute to the margin of support measured in a
            particular poll.  There is pollster-specific error and bias,
            sampling error, and statewide polling error (shared by all polling
            firms). So we can decompose $\pi_i$ into  components, $$
            \mathrm{logit}(\pi_i) = \mu[w_i] + \alpha_p[p_i] + \alpha_n[m_i] +
            \epsilon, $$
            where $\alpha_p$ is pollster-specific error, $\alpha_n$ is national
            polling error, and $\epsilon$ is sampling error. Polling firms can
            be biased towards either party:
            $$ \begin{align}
                \alpha_p[p_i] &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_p) \\
                \sigma_p &\sim \mathrm{U}(0, 15\%)
            \end{align} $$
            National polling error can also go either way. We use the
            historical bias as our prior, which is larger the farther out we are 
            from the election. Two years out, national polling is on average
            biased 5.5% toward the Democrats. By Election Day, this shrinks to 
            1.3%. Bias is estimated on a monthly basis:             
            $$ \begin{align}
                \alpha_n[m]  &\sim \mathcal{N}(bias_h[m], \mathbf{\Sigma_n}) \\
                \mathbf{\Sigma_n} &= \begin{pmatrix}
                    \sigma_n & \Sigma_n & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
                    \Sigma_n & \sigma_n & \Sigma_n & \dots & 0 \\
                    0 & \Sigma_n & \sigma_n & \dots & 0 \\
                    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                    0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & \sigma_n
                \end{pmatrix},
            \end{align} $$
            where $bias_h[m]$ is the historical bias in the national polling in
            month $m$, $\sigma_n$ is the variance in month-by-month bias across
            elections, and $\Sigma_n$ is the covariance between bias in
            adjacent months.

            Measurement noise is normally distributed around zero, with a
            standard error $\sigma_e$ having a uniform distribution between 0
            and 15%.

            To smooth out changes in polling and to obtain polling estimates
            for weeks in which no results are released, we use a reverse random
            walk prior for $\mu$:
            $$ \begin{align}
                \mu[w-1] &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu[w], \sigma) \\
                \sigma &\sim \mathrm{Lognormal}(\log(4\%), 1)
            \end{align} $$
            This random walk is also carried forward towards election day, to
            forecast future changes in the national sentiment.  </p>

            <h3>National Vote Margin Forecasting</h3>
            <p>
            We use a normal distribution as our prior for the final vote
            margin. The mean and variance of the distribution come from a
            linear model:
            $$ \begin{align}
                \mu[W] &\sim \mathcal{N}(MRG, \sqrt{MSE_{MRG}}) \\
                MRG &= a_0 + a_1APPR + a_2INC\times PRES + a_3PRES\times MID + e_a,
            \end{align} $$
            where $W$ is Election Day, $MRG$ is the expected national popular
            vote margin, $INC$ a categorical variable representing the
            incumbent majority party (+1 for the Democrats, –1 for the
            Republicans), $PRES$ is the sitting president&rsquo;s party (+1 for
            a Democrat, –1 for a Republican), $APPR$ is the average of sitting
            president&rsquo;s approval rating from January to June before the
            election, and $MID$ represents whether the election is a midterm (1
            if it is, 0 if not).  </p>

            <h3>House Race Forecasting</h3> <p> We use a linear model to
            forecast the margin each House race, $\mu_r$:
            $$ \begin{align}
                \mu_r &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathrm{logit}(
                    b_0 + b_1\mu[W] + b_2INC_r + b_3PVI_r + b_4PRES\_MRG 
                    + b_5PRES\times MID + e_b), \mathbf{\Sigma}) \\

                \mathbf{\Sigma} &= \begin{pmatrix}
                    \sigma_h & \Sigma_h & \dots & \Sigma_h \\
                    \Sigma_h & \sigma_h & \dots & \Sigma_h \\
                    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                    \Sigma_h & \Sigma_h & \dots & \sigma_h
                \end{pmatrix} + MSE_{MRG}
            \end{align} $$
            where $INC_r$ is a categorical variable representing the incumbent
            in the race (+1 for a Democrat, –1 for a Republican, and 0 for
            an open seat), $PVI$ is the partisan voting index of the
            district, and $PRES\_MRG$ is the Democratic margin of victory in the
            most recent presidential election. For the covariance matrix
            $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, we use historical values for the variance
            ($\sigma_h=0.019$) and covariance ($\Sigma_h=0.0040$) for each
            district and pair of districts, and add in the variance from the
            national vote margin forecast, $MSE_{MRG}$.  This gives about at
            20% correlation between the errors in each district.  </p> <p> The
            winner of each race is simply $\mathrm{sgn}(\mu_r)$, and the final
            seat margin in the U.S.  House is $$ \sum_r \mathrm{sgn}(\mu_r). $$
